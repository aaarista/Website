        		<h1>Final Project Introduction</h1>
			
			<p>
				In the last decade, commuter habits have been a central focus for New York City's elected 
				officials. One important strategy has been on the emphasis of using bicycles as a means 
				of transportation to get around the city. New York City has infused a great deal of budget 
				dollars into the investments necessary to make the city more bike friendly as well as safe
				for cycylists. Because the commuter logistics of a city play such a large roll in shaping a 
				city and how it functions, I have choosen to make this the focus of this project.
			
			</p>
			<h2>Project Focus</h2>
			<p>
				There will be three(3) primary areas of focus for the research and reporting to follow:
				<ol>
				<li>Pedestrian cyclists crossing the three main bridges in downtown Manhattan: Williamburg
					Bridge, Queensboro  Bridge, Manhattan Bridge.</li>
				<li>Analysis of Citi Bike data from the primary locations in key locations of high traffic
				   areas with heavy adoption of cycling as a way of moving around the city.</li> 
				<li>Analysis of changes and response of the choosen locations as well emerging areas with 
				   high commuter cyclist activity.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

		<h2>Primary Sources of Data and Data Wrangling/Analysis Tools</h2>
			<p>The two(2) resources for collecitng data are NYC Open Data and Citi Bike's data website source.
			   Also, the Vision Zero website was used as an initial source for ideas on layout and research
			   methods. For the wrangling, aggregating, charting, and analysis of data; Jupyter Notebook was
			   the tool that was employed for this project. 
			</p>
		<h1>Approach to Data Analysis</h1>
			<p>The approach used for data analysis was driven by three(3) seperate Jupyter Notebooks. The first notebook 
			derives its data from the NYCDOT bike counter. The focus of this notebook is general statistical analysis using the describe()
			method in pandas, showing aggregated data with charts for each of the three bridges by month, and showing a chart with
		        time series analysis. Notebook 1 is useful in that it provides a comparison of travel by bike of the three bridge provided,
			and also the impact of bike travel based on weather patterns for each bridge and time of the year.
			The second and third notebooks have similar structure to one another and are used
			to compare data from the same time of the year, with notebook 2 being from 2016 and notebook 3 being from 2018. The
			purpose of these two notebooks is to analyze the change over the course of two years. The primary focus of these two 
			notebooks are the top 20 locations of Citi Bike users by total customer trips. 
			</p> 
		<h2>Specific Data Analsis Techniques</h2>
			<p>The following techniques were used in the three notebooks:
				<ol>
					<li>Statistical measure of center</li>
					
					<li>Data manipulation techniques such as sorting, slicing, and indexing</li>
					
					<li>Aggregating and grouping of data</li>
					
					<li>Charts such as bar and line charts</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		<h2>Unfamiliar Data Techniques Used for this Project</h2> 
			<p>I decided to use Git Pages for this Project as the platform for my final project Jupyter Notebooks
			as well as for the presentation part of the final project. This is a tool that is unfamiliar to me and
			required me to gain a better understanding of basic html and css. The reason for my decision to use this 
			tool is that Github is a common tool used in the field and something we should become more familiar with.
			Also, becoming stronger with html and css is helpful for a data anlayst when webscraping and so it has a 
			practical utility. I imported and used glob, which is a package that I have never used and allowed me
			to concat several csv files into one file right on import ( Very helpful and saved time ). Lastly, he
			pairplot was very helpful in looking at the data for notebook 1. I allowed for a snapshot type of visual
			to assess the overall distribution, especially with respect to weather conditions and there impact on bike
			habits. 
			</p>
		
		<h1>Analysis and Conclusion to be Drawn from Data Analysis</h1>
		
		<h2>Notebook 1 - Bike Counter for Bridges</h2>
			<p>For the three bridges, the three highest months for the bike counter was June, August, and September.
			The same was true for the mean and median per day for those months. Another interesting fact is that the 
			three bridges have an extremely similar pattern when it comes to the impact of precipitation on biking 
			habits. From this data analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the habits of cycylist are extremely
			simialar for all three bridges. Therefore, incetives or policies that work for one could likely work for all.
			</p>
		
		<h2>Notebook 2 & 3 - Cite Bike</h2>
			<p>Notebooks 2 and 3 were compared to analyze trends and changes over time - over two years. The data is looked 
			at by analyzing the top twenty locations by overall users. The distribution of the mean trip duration was similar 
			over the two year span, although there was a slight increase in overall mean travel times. The chart showing total 
			trips from all sites for 2016 and for 2018 show a increase in both overall trip count and consistency over the two year
			time frame. So, while the average travel times remain similar, the overal use of bikes for travel, and the consistency 
			of that use throughout the month are consistent with a successful effort to increas bike travel in  New York City.
