        		<h1>Final Project Introduction</h1>
			
			<p>
				In the last decade, commuter habits have been a central focus for New York City's elected 
				officials. One important strategy has been on the emphasis of using bicycles as a means 
				of transportation to get around the city. New York City has infused a great deal of budget 
				dollars into the investments necessary to make the city more bike friendly as well as safe
				for cycylists. Because the commuter logistics of a city play such a large roll in shaping a 
				city and how it functions, I have choosen to make this the focus of this project.
			
			</p>
			<h2>Project Focus</h2>
			<p>
				There will be three(3) primary areas of focus for the research and reporting to follow:
				<ol>
				<li>Pedestrian cyclists crossing the three main bridges in downtown Manhattan: Williamburg
					Bridge, Queensboro  Bridge, Manhattan Bridge.</li>
				<li>Analysis of Citi Bike data from the primary locations in key locations of high traffic
				   areas with heavy adoption of cycling as a way of moving around the city.</li> 
				<li>Analysis of changes and adoptation of the choosen locations as well emerging areas with 
				   high commuter cyclist activity.</li>
				</ol>
