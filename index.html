        		<h1>Final Project Introduction</h1>
			
			<p>
				In the last decade, commuter habits have been a central focus for New York City's elected 
				officials. One important strategy has been on the emphasis of using bicycles as a means 
				of transportation to get around the city. New York City has infused a great deal of budget 
				dollars into the investments necessary to make the city more bike friendly as well as safe
				for cycylists. Because the commuter logistics of a city play such a large roll in shaping a 
				city and how it functions, I have choosen to make this the focus of this project.
			
			</p>
			<h2>Project Focus</h2>
			<p>
				There will be three(3) primary areas of focus for the research and reporting to follow:
				<ol>
				<li>Pedestrian cyclists crossing the three main bridges in downtown Manhattan: Williamburg
					Bridge, Queensboro  Bridge, Manhattan Bridge.</li>
				<li>Analysis of Citi Bike data from the primary locations in key locations of high traffic
				   areas with heavy adoption of cycling as a way of moving around the city.</li> 
				<li>Analysis of changes and response of the choosen locations as well emerging areas with 
				   high commuter cyclist activity.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

		<h2>Primary Sources of Data and Data Wrangling/Analysis Tools</h2>
			<p>The two(2) resources for collecitng data are NYC Open Data and Citi Bike's data website source.
			   Also, the Vision Zero website was used as an initial source for ideas on layout and research
			   methods. For the wrangling, aggregating, charting, and analysis of data; Jupyter Notebook was
			   the tool that was employed for this project. 
			</p>
		<h1>Approach to Data Analysis</h1>
			<p>The approach used for data analysis was driven by three(3) seperate Jupyter Notebooks. The first notebook 
			derives its data from the NYCDOT bike counter. The focus of this notebook is general statistical analysis using the describe()
			method in pandas, showing aggregated data with charts for each of the three bridges by month, and showing a chart with
		        time series analysis. Notebook 1 is useful in that it provides a comparison of travel by bike of the three bridge provided,
			and also the impact of bike travel based on weather patterns for each bridge and time of the year.
			The second and third notebooks have similar structure to one another and are used
			to compare data from the same time of the year, with notebook 2 being from 2016 and notebook 3 being from 2018. The
			purpose of these two notebooks is to analyze the change over the course of two years. The primary focus of these two 
			notebooks are the top 20 locations of Citi Bike users by total customer trips.
